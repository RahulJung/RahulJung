# Hey, Iâ€™m Rahul! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer whoâ€™s all about building things that just work â€” clean, simple, and scalable. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into generative AI and loving how itâ€™s changing the game. I enjoy mixing solid code with new AI tricks to create stuff that actually makes an impact. Always curious, always coding, and excited about whatâ€™s next. Letâ€™s build something awesome!

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-jung-chauhan/) â€” always happy to chat about software, AI, or tech in general!
